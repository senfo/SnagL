SnagL™ (Social Network Analysis Graph Live) is a light-weight, pluggable
web application that operates within the browser. It works with existing
applications and databases to provide a visual way to understand information and
enhance the understanding of it. In more general terms, it is an application
that can be easily added to an existing web site and is used to view and analyze
data in a visual manner.

SnagL™ is an active R&D project being developed and it was decided to release it
to you, the development community, as open source. This project follows no
specific release-cycle, so check back periodically for updates. If you would
like to participate in the development of SnagL™, please feel free to contact
the project maintainers.
